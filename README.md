(i) Polymorphism
Polymorphism means many forms.
 It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, and the correct method is called at runtime based on the actual object type.
Example:

(ii) Interface
An interface is a contract that defines what a class can do, without specifying how.
 It contains abstract methods (and constants) that implementing classes must override.
